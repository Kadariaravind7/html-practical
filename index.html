    <h1>kadari Aravind 22E11A0522</h1>
    <p>Through the dimly lit window of a train, a man stands quietly on the platform, lost in thought. The world outside seems to blur around him, while a soft light gently falls on his face, capturing a moment of calm reflection amidst the constant motion of travel. Dressed neatly in a dark coat and holding a patterned bag, he appears poised yet distant, as if waiting for something—or perhaps someone. The warm tones and deep shadows of the scene create a cinematic atmosphere, evoking feelings of solitude, nostalgia, and quiet contemplation. It is a fleeting glimpse into the life of a stranger, framed beautifully by the train’s window, turning an ordinary moment into something deeply poetic.</p>
